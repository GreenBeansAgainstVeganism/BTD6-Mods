# Finger Gun Mod
*Turning BTD6 into a point-&-click adventure since 2021!*

Ever wished you could participate directly in the war on bloons rather than comissioning monkey mercenaries to do it all for you? This mod allows you to pop bloons simply by clicking on them with your cursor. It requires a bit of precision and patience, but can help take the edge off of those incredibly precise expert chimps starts or to catch that stray red bloon that endeavors to end your Impoppable run.
