# Movable Towers Mod
A rewrite of an old mod by Gurrenm4 which works on version 28.0 of the game.

Press **shift** while a tower is selected to move it around with the mouse and **left-click** to place it down again, anywhere on the map (even if the location normally wouldn't be valid).

Code was adapted from Timotheeee's "Towers Follow Mouse" mod.
